# Word Correction and Probability Analysis

This Python script is designed to perform word correction and analyze word probabilities in a given text file. It uses natural language processing techniques to tokenize the text, calculate word frequencies, and provide word suggestions based on user input.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- `nltk` library (Natural Language Toolkit)
- `pattern` library
- Text file (`data.txt`) containing the text for analysis

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install nltk
pip install pattern
